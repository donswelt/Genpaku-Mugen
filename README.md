# Genpaku-Mugen
Another M.U.G.E.N. character I made decades ago.

## How to install

- Download MUGEN from whereever it is available this age.
- Unzip it to your Harddrive
- Create the sub folder GENPAKU in MUGEN\CHARS\
- edit MUGEN\DATA\SELECT.CFG and insert the following line:
'genpaku'

For more information, refer to the original M.U.G.E.N documents coming with M.U.G.E.N
